# BD Fitter


This python package is for fitting brown dwarf (substellar mass object) photometry.  It currently supports the Sonora Bobcat, Cholla, Diamondback and Elf Owl models, and the LOW-Z models.
Photometry for a range of filters is provided, and if more are needed the models are automatically downloaded from Zenodo/Harvard DataVerse if not found in directory code is run in.

Please cite all fitted model papers and repositories DOIs if you use this code, this would not be possible without the hard work of the authors of these models.

## Installation

Clone this repository into a folder, and then do pip install . to install. 

An example of use is available in examples/chi2_testing.ipynb. All the user needs to provide is an array of flux and flux uncertainity, and a list of bands (in SVO filter format, or abbreviated will work if HST/NIRcam filters).

Code is still a work in progress. Contact the author at: thomas.harvey-3@manchester.ac.uk for help, improvements, problems, bugs, complaints etc...
